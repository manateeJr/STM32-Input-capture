# STM32-Input-capture
This project makes use of the input capture functionality of general purpose timers on the STM32 board (ARM Cortex M4 MCU)

I executed this project for Fontys in Semester 3, Embedded Software. There is a detailed description of the problem and my take on it in the form of a report in this 
folder. A video link can be found below with a demonstration. 

In essence, the problem entails in reading an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and display the output in your own way. I decided to display the output with an LED in PWM mode. 
The closer the object is to the sensor, the brighter the LED shines.
